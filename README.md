# RVITM-Bank
This project utilizes UiPath RPA technology to scrape data from a web page created by our team for RvITM Bank. The scraped data is then stored in an Excel sheet. Additionally, a C program has been developed to apply searching and sorting algorithms on this data.
In this project, we have employed UiPath RPA technology to automate the process of extracting data from a specific web page. The web page, named RvITM Bank, was created by our team. The extracted data is saved in an Excel sheet for further analysis and processing. To enhance the functionality of the project, we have implemented a C program that incorporates searching and sorting algorithms, allowing users to efficiently interact with the data.

Features:
>>Automated data scraping from the RvITM Bank web page using UiPath RPA
>>Storage of scraped data in an Excel sheet
>>Implementation of searching and sorting algorithms in a C program
